# The discipline of learning

## General Overview
This project is meant to be a multiservice platform where each service handles a module (basically a resource/entity CRUD).   
What I am trying to accomplish is to make a project made up of many different languages and tools on which I have knowledge of.

The languages:
* Golang
* Php
* Python
* Typescript
* Mysql query language

The tools:
* Docker
